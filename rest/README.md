All projects in this directory are used to continue learning Jetty while also learning how to build RESTful applications.
Some of the projects are being created while reading the RESTful Java book, with the main difference being that the book
uses Jboss with RESTeasy and I have decided to use Jetty with Jersey.

The order-entry-system project leaves room for learning other technologies, and I will most likely be adding persistence to this project
while learning hibernate, and expanding on the project as I learn other technologies.
